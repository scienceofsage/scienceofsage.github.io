Everybody likes hearing songs when they is happy or sad or have nothing to do but ever wondered what the sound can actually do to your body?

Well... the truth must be spoken. The fact is that we have always perceived sound in terms of notes, harmony, and softness but let us re-visit the technical terms once taught to us in our school days-- frequency, vibrations, wavelengths, etc.

 So as we try to understand the universe and its laws in depth we realize that everything is energy. We might as well say that the matter is not much different from energy itself and this has been proven by science. For what we know atom is not the fundamental unit of matter, rather it can be further broken down into smaller particles which when further magnified turned out to be nothing more than clouds of energy.

Hence the Einstein’s equation that gives us:

> E= mc^2        
implies mass is also a form of energy.

Now we know mathematically that everything is energy so there is always going to be a set of vibrations, frequencies and wavelengths associated with it. Therefore, we can say that our body is nothing but a big compact structure of energy and we have characteristic vibrations. To explain it in a simpler way, we all have had experiences about people’s vibes i.e we meet some people and without knowing them we get positive or negative vibes from them. VIBE is nothing but an acronym for vibration and in this example, we understand that we have the ability to sense people’s energies.

As Nikola Tesla said,

> "If you want to know the secrets of the universe then think in terms of energy, vibrations, and frequency."

So, now that we know our body is nothing but energy, therefore, it should be understood that the vibrations we are offering because it is essential to know that we have control over our vibrations and frequency at our will. A person with a positive cheerful attitude offers a high vibration and a negative sad person offers a negative vibration. Hence we can conclude that it is our emotions that dictate our vibrations which we know can be controlled. So, we understood the concept of energy, vibrations, and frequency. Now let us relate it to music.

Music is Sound which also has characteristic vibrations and frequency just like our bodies so when we match our vibrations with the frequency of the music we encounter the phenomenon known as Resonance. It means that when two bodies are of the same vibrational frequency heir amplitude of vibration increases to a very high level.

In simple language when two friends are happy. When they meet each other their happiness increases because they are happy for each other as well. Hence they end up offering a greater positive vibration than they were offering initially by just themselves. So is the effect of music i.e when we match our vibrations with the music we listen to our vibrational alignment changes accordingly.

A research was done by Dr. Masaru Emoto according to which when the music of certain frequencies was played to water and then the water was frozen and its crystal structure was observed. It was observed that at certain frequencies a perfect structure with six or 12 fold symmetry was observed.

As he concluded

> Words are Alive and can affect the natural processes.

So, it was concluded that music has the ability to align molecules and thus change their structure. Now, we know that our body is 70% water thus when we subject ourselves to these frequencies our body gives a similar effect i.e our body goes under an alignment which is both physical as well as mental or vibrational. The consequence of the physical alignment is that all the energy blocks inside the body are cleared and energy flows easily in every art thus creating a healing effect on the required parts. Isn’t it just fantastic?

Now, let us talk about vibrational alignment at these frequencies are subconscious mind becomes prone to all types of suggestions that are associated with these vibrations

Also known as Solfeggio frequencies some of which are:

- 432 Hz- is the nature’s frequency

- RE – 417 Hz – Undoing Situations and Facilitating Change

- MI – 528 Hz – Transformation and Miracles (DNA Repair)/ Infinite Love

- FA – 639 Hz – Connecting/Relationships

- SOL – 741 Hz – Awakening Intuition

- LA – 852 Hz – Returning to Spiritual Order.

and so when we subject ourselves to these frequencies our mental blockages get freed and we get aligned with the feelings or emotions associated with these vibrations. For eg., A person who is insecure about his/ her relationship would see the negative constricted emotions associated with love failure fading away and becoming more open to the universal love.

Hence music with such frequency can help us alter our beliefs regarding various aspects in life and thus help us in improving our ability to get rid of the mental blockages we have due to various experiences we have had.

Further more information about the topic I’ll be adding to my soon coming blog post.
